# CIS-315-Weighted-Directed-Acyclic-Graph
This is a program which takes the description of a weighted
directed acyclic graph from standard input and writes to standard output two numbers measuring
the graph. The program computes (i) the length of the longest path from Node 1 to
Node N , and (ii) the number of distinct paths from Node 1 to Node N that have the longest length
found in part (i).
The program implements a linear time (i.e., O(n + m) if using an adjacency list
and O(n2) if using an adjacency matrix) algorithm and is tested on very large graphs.
